**2\. OpenAI Whisper:**
-----------------------

OpenAI's deep learning research led to the launching of the open-source speech-to-text whisper model. The Whisper ASR system is known for its exceptional handling of diverse audio qualities. This makes it an indispensable tool for transcribing a wide spectrum of audio content, from podcasts with varying sound quality to lectures in noisy conditions.

Whisper's robustness comes from its ability to adapt to varying audio conditions, making it efficient in transcribing even in less-than-ideal sound environments. This versatility is a testament to its state-of-the-art design.

The Audio API provided with Whisper includes two speech-to-text endpoints: transcriptions and translations. 

### These API endpoints help users by:

1.  This feature transcribes audio content into the language of the original audio. It is particularly useful when dealing with multilingual audio content and when accurate transcription of the original language is essential.  
    
2.  Translate and transcribe the audio content into English, providing a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing content in languages the user might not be familiar with.  
    

The biggest issue with Whisper is that the file uploads are currently limited to 25MB, ensuring a balance between quality and resource utilisation. The supported input file types include mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, and webm, providing various options for different user needs. Whisper by OpenAI is priced at $0.006 per minute, which is very costly because you can get the exact same model deployed at a much lesser cost.

**3\. Microsoft Azure Speech-to-Text:**
---------------------------------------

Microsoft Azure Speech-to-Text offers unmatched versatility for speech transcription. Leverage state-of-the-art speech recognition to achieve high-quality audio-to-text conversions.

Need to understand industry-specific lingo? Azure gives you the flexibility to finetune your speech models to recognise your unique vocabulary or build entirely new models for maximum accuracy. Azure provides the flexibility to deploy Speech to Text wherever you work, in the cloud or at the edge in containers. Furthermore, you benefit from production-ready technology trusted by Microsoft products.

Beyond impressive accuracy, Azure empowers you to transcribe speech from multiple sources, including microphones, audio files, and cloud storage. An interesting feature by Microsoft is Speaker diarisation, which helps identify individual speakers, while automatic formatting and punctuation ensure your transcripts are clear and readable. And if you face challenges like background noise or accents, Azure allows you to customize speech models using your own data or leverage Office 365 data to automatically generate custom models optimized for your organization.

Microsoft is a comparatively costly ASR service, billing $1 per hour. Azure is a great STT API to get started, but it is difficult to implement at scale.

​**4\. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text:**​  

-----------------------------------------

A popular choice for its fast processing, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text is a reliable option. However, it can be costlier than some competitors. Pricing starts at $0.006 per word.

AssemblyAI goes beyond basic transcription. This user-friendly platform offers features like speaker diarisation (starting at $0.02/minute), sentiment analysis (starting at $0.04/minute), and real-time transcription, making it perfect for complex audio with multiple speakers or emotional nuances.

6\. Deepgram:

Deepgram boasts industry-leading accuracy with a tiered approach. Choose from Base ($0.06/minute), Enhanced ($0.10/minute), or Nova-2 ($0.20/minute) models, or even train your own custom model for specialized needs.

9. **IBM Watson Speech-to-Text:**
